  Information @ Observation.component[0] (line 6, col760): This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/bp|4.0.1 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
  Information @ Observation (line 6, col762): Validate Observation against the Blood pressure systolic and diastolic profile (http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/bp) which is required by the FHIR specification because the LOINC code 85354-9 was found

  Warning @ Observation.component[0].value.ofType(Quantity) (line 2, col788): UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {score} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked
  Warning @ Observation.code (line 215, col397): None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Vital Signs' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-vitalsignresult|4.0.1), and a coding should come from this value set unless it has no suitable code (note that the validator cannot judge what is suitable) (codes = http://loinc.org#2713-6)
  Warning @ Observation.component[0].code (line 215, col688): None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Vital Signs' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-vitalsignresult|4.0.1), and a coding should come from this value set unless it has no suitable code (note that the validator cannot judge what is suitable) (codes = http://loinc.org#2713-6)
  Warning @ Observation (line 1, col681): Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
